Memory Game

This is a simple memory card game I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You flip the cards to find matching colors.

How to play:
Click a card to flip it.
Click another to try and match it.
If they match, they stay flipped.
If not, they flip back.
Match all pairs to win.
Click Restart to play again.

Setup:
Open `index.html` in a browser.
That’s it
